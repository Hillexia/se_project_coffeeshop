# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

For me, this was a difficult project. I have lots to learn and lots to practice such as animations, the CSS line for "position" and its definition. That being said, i want to continue to find ways to continue to pratice this and apply it to my future project such as making dummy websites with what i have learned so far. At the moment, i cannot find an idea of improvement for this project as i feel this project challenged me very well in all i have learned in this sprint.
